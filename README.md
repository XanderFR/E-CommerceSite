# E-Commerce Site
A Python-based web application that functions similarly to an E-Commerce website (minus credit card processing). The app utilizes Django, Bootstrap, and JQuery. Product information is fed into the app through its admin interface and displayed on the index page which includes links to pages with details on the individual products. The app has online cart functionality with a popover that takes users to a checkout page where they can see the products they want and can fill out and submit an online form with their order information. Both product and order information is stored in a SQLite3 database.
